## What are Pointer types in C#
To put it simply, a pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable or type (Pluralsight, 2025). 
- **When they are used** - By using the asterisk (*) symbol with the type specification, pointers can be declared in an unsafe context (Rashid, 2016). To retrieve the real content from a place indicated by a pointer variable (Rashid, 2016).
- **Why they require unsafe context** - Calling native functions that need pointer types requiresÂ unsafe context (Microsoft Learn, 2025b).
